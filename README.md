## 🏆 Live Football World Cup Score Board

A lightweight Java library for managing ongoing World Cup match results.

The library uses the `WorldCupMatch` data object to represent matches and supports the following operations:

- Start a new match  
- Update match scores  
- Finish a match  
- Get a summary of matches in progress  

---

## 🛠️ Development Approach

The implementation followed TDD principles and hence was test driven. As new tests were added, the necessary parts of the library were implemented incrementally.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Environment

- **Build tool:** Apache Maven 3.9.12  
  - Run tests with: `mvn test`  
- **Java version:** OpenJDK 25.0.2  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (primary development environment)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Planned performance improvements (Big-O optimizations) were not completed due to time constraints.  
- For typical World Cup usage volumes, the current implementation should perform adequately.

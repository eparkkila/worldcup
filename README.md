This is a simple implementation of the Sportradar exercise.
The progrm uses homeTeam and visitorTeam as keys when the supported actions are called.
  - Start a new match
  - Update score
  - Finish
  - Get a summary of mathches in progres

The implementation started from obvious unit tests (shown in the code) and while I added the test sI simultanuously coded the necessary part of library.
